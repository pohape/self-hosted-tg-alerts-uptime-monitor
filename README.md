### ⚡ Quick Start
Spin up your own uptime monitor with Telegram alerts in just a few steps:
#### 🔧 1. Clone the repo & install dependencies
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor
cd self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
![Step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step1.gif)

#### 🤖 2. Create a Telegram bot
Chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), create a new bot, and copy the token.
![Step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step2.gif)

#### ✍️ 3. Create the config file
Initialize your config.yaml with your Telegram bot token:
```shell
echo "telegram_bot_token: '12345:SDGFFHWRE-EW3b16Q'" > config.yaml
```
![Step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step3.gif)

#### 🆔 4. Get your Telegram chat ID
Start the bot in ID mode to find out your user/chat ID:
```shell
python3 run.py --id-bot-mode
```
➡️ Send any message to your bot, or forward a message from the group where you want to receive notifications.  
🛠️ If you want to receive notifications in a group, make sure the bot has been added to that group.
![Step 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step4.gif)

#### ✍️ 5. Add a site to monitor
Edit **config.yaml** and define your site(s):

```yaml
telegram_bot_token: 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'

sites:
  homepage:
    url: "https://example.com"
    search_string: "Example Domain"
    tg_chats_to_notify:
      - '123456789'  # your Telegram user or chat ID
```
![Step 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step5.gif)

#### 💯 6. Test your setup
This will validate the configuration for each site and display any issues:
```shell
python3 run.py --check-config
```
Make sure Telegram alerts work:
```shell
python3 run.py --test-notifications
```
You’ll get a test message in every listed chat — or a clear error if something’s wrong.
![Step 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step6.gif)

#### 🚀 7. Run a manual check
Force a one-time check of all sites:
```shell
python3 run.py --force
```
![Step 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step7.gif)

#### 🕒 8. Add to crontab
Enter your crontab:
```shell
crontab -e
```
Then add this line (replace **/path/to/repo** with the actual path to your cloned project):
```shell
* * * * * /path/to/repo/venv/bin/python /path/to/repo/run.py
```
📅 The entry point runs every minute, but each site is checked according to its own schedule, defined in the **config.yaml** using cron syntax
![Step 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pohape/self-hosted-tg-alerts-uptime-monitor-assets/main/step8.gif)

#### ⏰ 9. Simulate downtime and recovery (optional)

### Usage

#### To run the script normally, simply execute:

```shell
python3 run.py
```

#### To test Telegram notifications:

```shell
python3 run.py --test-notifications
```

#### To start the Telegram bot that replies with user IDs using long polling:

```shell
python3 run.py --id-bot-mode
```

#### To force check all sites immediately:

```shell
python3 run.py --force
```
Example results:
```diff
+ Request to home_page completed successfully.

- Error for not_found: Expected status code '404', but got '200'
+ A message with the error sent to 5487855 successfully
```

#### To check the configuration for any issues:

```shell
python3 run.py --check-config
```
Example results:
```diff

- **telegram_bot_token**: Your Telegram bot token obtained from @BotFather.

- **url**: The URL of the site to monitor.
- **follow_redirects**: (optional, default is False): Whether to follow HTTP redirects during the request.
- **method** (optional, default is GET): The HTTP method to use (GET, POST, HEAD).
- **headers** (optional): A dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the request.
- **post_data** (optional): Only for the POST method.

### 🔄 Smart Recovery Notifications

- 🚨 One alert after N consecutive failures (no spam or duplicate messages)
- 🔁 Continues checking once a minute during downtime (ignoring the original schedule temporarily)
- ✅ "Back online" message sent when site recovers, with:
  - Duration of downtime (in minutes)
  - Number of failed checks
- 📆 After recovery, monitoring returns to your custom schedule — fully automated.

### 📊 Automated Summary Reports

- 📅 **Scheduled Summaries**: Configure periodic summary reports using cron syntax
- 🎯 **Smart Filtering**: Summaries are only sent when there are actually failing services
- 📋 **Comprehensive Overview**: Shows all services currently down with error details and duration
- 📢 **Broadcast Delivery**: Sent to all unique chat IDs from your monitored sites
